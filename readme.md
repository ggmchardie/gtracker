### Design and Planning ###

1. I started out with a very basic user flow


![planning_1.jpg](/home/georgia/Documents/Gtracker/Docs/planning_1.jpg"workflow - stage one")




2. I began labelling sections of my diagram with the code i thought i might use


![planning_2.jpg](/home/georgia/Documents/Gtracker/Docs/planning_2.jpg "workflow - stage 2")



3. I created my Trello board and color coded my work      flow diagram to my Trello board

![trello_1.jpg](/home/georgia/Documents/Gtracker/Docs/trello_1.jpg "First Trello board")

![trello_2.jpg](/home/georgia/Documents/Gtracker/Docs/trello_2.jpg "Trello update 2")




4. I broke down the propsed tasks on my Trello into        hour blocks

![trello_3](/home/georgia/Documents/Gtracker/Docs/trello_2.jpg "Trello update 3")


5. I added checkboxes onto each part of my workflow       diagram  and color coded the parts I would try do      with extra time. to I could keep track of what I       had done and what was next.
